      <h2>Opis gatunku</h2>
      <p>The Northern Goshawk (<em>Accipiter gentilis</em>) is a powerful and elusive bird of prey, often referred to as the ‚Äúphantom of the forest.‚Äù  Known for its fierce hunting prowess and secretive nature, it holds a prominent place in the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Size:</strong>  A large accipiter, with females significantly larger than males.  They typically range from 46-68 cm (18-27 in) in length with a wingspan of 90-127 cm (35-50 in).</li>
  <li><strong>Plumage:</strong> Adults have a slate-grey back and wings, a white underside with fine dark streaks, and a distinctive black cap and a white ‚Äúeyebrow‚Äù (supercilium) above a striking red eye. Juveniles are brown with buffy underparts and streaking, gradually acquiring adult plumage over several years.</li>
  <li><strong>Flight:</strong>  Characterized by rapid wingbeats and soaring flight.  They are highly maneuverable in dense forests, enabling them to pursue prey through complex vegetation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="habitat-and-distribution">Habitat and Distribution</h3>

<p>Northern Goshawks are found across North America, Europe, and Asia. They prefer mature forests, both coniferous and deciduous, with a dense canopy and ample understory.  They require large, undisturbed tracts of forest for nesting and hunting.</p>

<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

<p>Goshawks are apex predators, primarily feeding on medium-sized birds and mammals. Their diet includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Birds:</strong>  Pigeons, doves, grouse, pheasants, woodpeckers, jays, and songbirds.</li>
  <li><strong>Mammals:</strong>  Squirrels, rabbits, hares, voles, and chipmunks.</li>
  <li><strong>Occasionally:</strong>  Reptiles, amphibians, and insects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hunting-techniques">Hunting Techniques</h3>

<p>Goshawks are ambush hunters, relying on speed and agility to capture their prey. They often perch silently within the forest canopy, waiting for an unsuspecting animal to pass below. They may also hunt by flying low and fast through the trees, surprising their quarry. Their sharp talons and powerful beaks make them formidable hunters.</p>

<h3 id="breeding-and-nesting">Breeding and Nesting</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nesting:</strong> Goshawks build large stick nests high in trees, often near the edge of a forest clearing.</li>
  <li><strong>Breeding Season:</strong>  Typically begins in spring.</li>
  <li><strong>Clutch Size:</strong>  Usually 2-5 eggs.</li>
  <li><strong>Parental Care:</strong>  Both parents participate in incubating the eggs and raising the young.  Young goshawks fledge (leave the nest) after several weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conservation-status">Conservation Status</h3>

<p>While generally not considered globally threatened, Northern Goshawk populations face challenges in some areas due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong>  Deforestation and fragmentation of forests are major threats.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Persecution:</strong>  Historically, goshawks were sometimes targeted due to perceived threats to poultry or game birds.</li>
  <li><strong>Pesticide Use:</strong>  Accumulation of pesticides in their prey can impact goshawk health and reproduction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interesting-facts">Interesting Facts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Goshawks are known for their fierce defense of their nests, readily attacking intruders, including humans.</li>
  <li>Their scientific name, <em>Accipiter gentilis</em>, translates to ‚Äúnoble hawk,‚Äù reflecting their regal appearance and hunting prowess.</li>
  <li>They have been used in falconry for centuries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observing-goshawks">Observing Goshawks</h3>

<p>Due to their elusive nature and preference for dense forests, observing goshawks in the wild can be challenging.  Patience and knowledge of their habitat preferences are key.  Look for signs of their presence, such as shed feathers or prey remains.  Early morning or late afternoon, when they are most active, are the best times to try and spot them.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Northern Goshawk is a magnificent bird of prey, playing a vital role in forest ecosystems.  Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the continued survival of this ‚Äúphantom of the forest‚Äù for generations to come.</p>
