## Opis gatunku

The **Eurasian beaver** (*Castor fiber*) is one of two living species of beavers, along with the **North American beaver** (*Castor canadensis*).  
It is the **largest rodent in Europe** and inhabits rivers, lakes, and wetlands across much of the continent.  

### Physical Characteristics

* Large, robust body with **thick, waterproof fur** that provides insulation in cold water.
* **Flat, paddle-like tail**, used for swimming, communication (tail slapping), and fat storage.
* **Webbed hind feet** for powerful swimming, while the front paws are dexterous for manipulating objects.
* Large, ever-growing **chisel-shaped incisors**, reinforced with iron, allowing them to cut through wood efficiently.

### Behavior and Lifestyle

* Beavers are **highly social animals**, living in family units composed of a **monogamous breeding pair** and their offspring.
* They are **primarily nocturnal**, engaging in feeding and construction activities at night.
* Beavers construct **lodges** made of sticks and mud, which provide protection from predators and extreme temperatures.
* They **communicate using vocalizations**, scent marking, and **tail slapping** on the water to warn of danger.

### Habitat and Ecological Impact

* Eurasian beavers are **ecosystem engineers**â€”they modify their surroundings by **building dams**, which:
  * Create **wetlands** that support biodiversity.
  * Improve **water quality** by reducing erosion and filtering sediments.
  * Help **regulate water flow**, reducing the risk of floods and droughts.
* Unlike their North American counterparts, Eurasian beavers build **fewer dams**, often preferring to burrow into riverbanks.

### Diet

* **Strict herbivores**, consuming **bark, twigs, leaves, aquatic plants, and roots**.
* In winter, beavers **store food underwater**, ensuring access to nourishment when the water is frozen.

### Reproduction and Lifecycle

* Mating season occurs in **January-February**.
* Gestation lasts **about 105 days**, with **2-4 kits** born in late spring.
* Kits are born **fully furred and with open eyes**, capable of swimming within a few days.
* Young beavers stay with their parents for **2-3 years**, helping with dam building and territory defense before dispersing.

### Conservation Status

* The Eurasian beaver was **nearly extinct** due to **fur hunting, habitat destruction, and persecution**.
* Populations declined to fewer than **1,200 individuals** by the early 20th century.
* **Successful reintroduction programs** across Europe have led to **population recovery**, with over **1.5 million individuals today**.
* Protected by **European wildlife laws**, including the **EU Habitats Directive**.

### Interesting Facts

* Beavers can **stay underwater for up to 15 minutes** by slowing their heart rate.
* They **do not eat fish**, despite myths suggesting otherwise.
* Their **incisors never stop growing**, requiring constant gnawing to prevent overgrowth.
* Beavers were once **hunted for castoreum**, a secretion from their scent glands used in perfume and medicine.

### Conclusion

The **Eurasian beaver** is a **keystone species** that plays a crucial role in shaping wetland ecosystems.  
Its **conservation success story** highlights the impact of **wildlife protection efforts** and demonstrates how species recovery can benefit entire ecosystems.  
Today, the beaver is once again a **thriving symbol of European nature**.
